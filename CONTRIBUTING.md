## :warning: Commit Message Format

Please read [docs](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/?ref=blog.opensight.ch) before making a commit.

The general idea is you need to prepend all commits with with ['fix:', 'feat:', 'docs:', 'chore:'] depending on how the version number should be incremented. A changelog will automatically be created from these comments

A commit message format will look like 

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```
